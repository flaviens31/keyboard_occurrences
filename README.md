# keyboard_occurrences
The Keyboard Occurrence project is a Flutter application that demonstrates interactive drag-and-drop functionality with letter tiles. Users can drag letters onto a drop target, decrementing the occurrence count displayed on each tile. This simple yet interactive interface provides a hands-on example of how to implement draggable widgets in Flutter.
