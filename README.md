## Description

The Keyboard Occurrences application is built using Flutter and Dart. It provides a graphical interface where users can drop letters onto a designated area and manage their occurrences dynamically. The application supports drag-and-drop functionality to simulate letter dropping and updates occurrences in real-time.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Flutter installed. For installation instructions, refer to the [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flaviens31/keyboard_occurrences.git
   cd keyboard_occurrences
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**
   - Open the project in your preferred Flutter IDE or editor.

2. **Build and Run:**
   - Ensure your device or emulator is connected and recognized by Flutter.
   - Run the application using the command:

     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

   - This command will compile the Flutter code and deploy the application to your device or emulator.

3. **Interact with the Application:**
   - The application displays a screen with draggable letters and a drop area.
   - Drag the letters onto the drop area to decrement their occurrence count.
   - The occurrence count updates visually on each letter.
   - Experiment with different interactions to explore the functionality.

4. **Explore the Code:**
   - Review the Dart code in your IDE to understand how the draggable letters and occurrence counts are managed.
   - Modify the code to experiment with different features or behaviors.

5. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you encounter any issues during setup or execution, refer to the [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) or community resources for assistance.
